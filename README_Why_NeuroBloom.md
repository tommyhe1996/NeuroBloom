### ðŸŒº Why NeuroBloom?

> NeuroBloom is more than a journaling app â€” itâ€™s a *gentle space* for neurodivergent minds to express, reflect, and grow.  

Whether you're navigating emotional waves, celebrating small victories, or simply sitting with silence, NeuroBloom invites you to track your mood with ease, write with authenticity, and bloom at your own rhythm.

This project is built with sensory-friendly design, poetic affirmation, and the belief that **reflection is a form of growth** â€” especially for those whose inner worlds deserve more space to breathe.
