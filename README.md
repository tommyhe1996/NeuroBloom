## 🌿 Neurodivergent Design Principles

- **Minimalist Layout:** clean, decluttered interface for easier focus  
- **Sensory Safety:** light backgrounds, gentle colors, low-intensity visuals  
- **Open Expression:** freeform journaling, emoji expression, and affirmations  
- **No Pressure:** no streaks, no required inputs — only invitation to reflect  
- **Creative Metaphors:** use of blooming petals and plants as healing metaphors
